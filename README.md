# AssertAutoIgnore

A brute-force module that's no better than an auto clicker for ignoring those RGL assert popups. Some RGL asserts may pop up before any submodules are loaded - those asserts cannot be caught within the submodule system.

Install like any other module and set this module to load before any others

Does not require any other mods

Only works for the modding tools
