# AssertAutoIgnore

A brute-force module that's no better than an auto clicker for ignoring those RGL assert popups. Some RGL asserts may pop up before any submodules are loaded - those asserts cannot be caught within the submodule system.

Install like any other module and set this moduile to load before any others

Does not require any other mods
